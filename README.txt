IMPORTANT:
THERE ARE two migrations scripts, and this one is not the most up to date.
See: http://drupal.org/node/57197



DO:
1. drop the whole phpbb2drupal sub-directory into your modules directory.
2. Enable the module at admin/modules.
3. visit the page admin/phpbb2drupal and follow the directions on screen.
